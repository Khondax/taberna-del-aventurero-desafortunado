# Experience First

When implementation convenience conflicts with user delight, choose delight.

- Every feature, control, and option must be justified
- Ship less, ship better (polished experience with three features beats rough one with ten)
- Prototype before committing (design decisions are cheaper in throwaway HTML than production code)
- Get the details right (transitions, alignment, spacing, feedback, error states)
- Tighten the core loop (every feature should serve the central workflow or get out of the way)

The user is whoever consumes the work. For a UI that is the end user. For a library or an internal API it is the colleague who imports it. The engineer who maintains the code next is a user too. Weigh their experience the same way, and explain impact from their perspective.

Foundations should serve the experience. Foundational thinking governs the *sequence* of work. This principle governs the *target*.

## Project compatibility

Apply these instructions within the repository's `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`. Those files and the user's current request take precedence. Adapt the workflow to tools that are actually available; do not claim a tool, model, reviewer, or check was used when it was not. Do not spawn subagents unless the user or repository instructions explicitly request delegation. If this skill calls for parallel reviewers or workers, perform independent passes sequentially when delegation is not authorized. Do not add or run tests unless the user asks. Keep changes within the requested scope, do not create commits or pull requests unless requested, and retain any project-specific security, privacy, deployment, and approval constraints. Continue through reversible work without waiting for approval; pause only when information is essential or before a destructive or external action that needs authorization.
